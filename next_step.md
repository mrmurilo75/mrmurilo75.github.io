## Goals

This site is a hub of knowledge for myself. Not only will I write studies/posts, but I plan on having most - if not all - the information that can be shared in here. It might be too ambitious, but we should always **strive for greatness**. In light of this objective, I'll keep this page as a tracker for the next change to be made to this site.

### Jekyll Theme and Sections

I want this site to have a better structure. I've seen Jekyll [themes that have multiple tabs][theme-al-folio], even with dropdowns. I plan on replicating such functions, but first I need to plan out how that is going to be done. Here's the planned sections so far:

1. **Posts**: I want the blog posts to be, by default, finished articles/studies related to technology and software.
2. **Zettel**: I'll likely implement over time a simple zettelkasten-like structure, and give it it's own section. 
    I'll still write a section on the home page and a post talking about [zettelkasten][zettelkasten]. 
3. **Projects**: A projects section to keep track of development of ongoing projects and plan future ones.
4. **Hobbies? Life?** I want to have my reflection anything unrelated as well. Besides the zettelkasten (which would encompass it all), I would like to have finished essays as well and maybe reports on real-life adventures.

### Distilled Action

I realise the above is a bit too much for only one task. It is not a task, but a project within the wider project that is this site (I haven't figured terminology for it yet). Here's the planned next steps:
1. Finish up reading the [Jekyll Docs](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/)
2. Write up ideas and relevant informations
3. Plan next actions based on new information
