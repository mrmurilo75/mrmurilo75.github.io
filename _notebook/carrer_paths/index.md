I have created the following few prompts to create a curriculum for a given subject.

```plaintext
For each subject in a list of subjects, list out the subjects that would be fundamental
Relate the subjects to its use case in { given subject }
```

```plaintext
Relate all these subjects in a skill tree, where each note is the relevant fundamental knowledge summary of the relationship
```

```plaintext
Make a curriculum by chapter of books, where the relation between subjects is shown and explained. Give a concise amount options of books and chapters, at least two different books and as many chapters as possible.
```

```plaintext
Give resources to test the knowledge for each subject, like book examples or projects ideas
```
