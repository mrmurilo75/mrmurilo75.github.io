## Focus

This is not the page that I wanted to make. As per [the next step][next-step] at time of writing, I would be continuing the implementation of this site using the collections of Jekyll. But that would require time and focus, which I haven't had. I got side-tracked on installing and setting up a new Linux Laptop (I'll write a post about it later), as well as planning how I'll move forward here - how to separate the content, make references, etc. 

Although planning and preparing your environment truly is important, **sometimes we get too caught up in the planning and forget about the doing**. It was taking me too long to set up the environment to put the information in here, so I'll make this a temporary solution. I'll put some things that I want to keep in mind, notes, or some reference that I want to get back to. I'm not forgetting that the objective of this project is to: (1) put information in a way that is accessible to myself, and (2) organize it in such a way that I can reference it. For the time, I'll focus on the first rather than the latter.
