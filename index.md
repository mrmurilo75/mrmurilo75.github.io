# Welcome! 
This is my personal space where I'll write about (most) thing I learn, as we'll as keep track of ongoing projects.
If you'd like to know a little bit more about my professional experiences, check out my [CV](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1PB8ULT-Ztmz7tau9M99mGfFXG60ruNdX/view?usp=drive_link).

# Why this site came to be
I wanted an online space to have my personal notes, so I wouldn't need to keep backups, or be locked into a software. My first idea was to have a fully fledge Django site - more specifically Wagtail. But as I got older and wiser I realised that it was overkill, and that the inital investment for it wasn't worth. Less is more, so Jekyll and Github Pages are just about enough. Git by design solves the backups issue, and Jekyll solves the software issue by using markdown (which is basically text++).

# What's next
As a guiding principle, I've come the realisation that incremental changes are the way to go. I have many areas of knowledge and discussions with my self that I plan to put in here, but not all at once. One goal of this space is that if I ever need to replicate a task or project, I should have all the necessary resources in here, as well as the reasoning behind any key-decisions (hence the discussions with myself).

At the moment of writing, this is the only content on the site. As a starting point, it makes sense that the first post is a guide and discussion on how this very site was built and deployed. After such any progressive change should be accompanied by a post, note, or other study and review mechanism that is implemented.
