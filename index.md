# Welcome!

This is my personal space where I'll write about (most) things I learn, as well as keep track of projects.
If you'd like to know a little bit more about my professional experiences, check out my [resume] (also available in [portuguese][portuguese-resume]).

> Note: The resume page is a self-suficient HTML file! This means you can download and use it offline - it has no script and the css is embedeed.
> You can also print it to PDF (although page breaks might make it look worse).

## Why this site came to be

I wanted an online space to have my personal notes, so I wouldn't need to keep backups, or be locked into a software. My first idea was to have a fully fledge Django site - more specifically Wagtail. But as I got older and wiser I realised that it was overkill, and that the inital investment for it wasn't worth. Since **less is more**, I figured that Jekyll and Github Pages were more than enough. Git by design solves the backups issue, and Jekyll solves the software issue by using markdown (which is basically text++).

## What's next

I have a lot of knowledge and discussions with myself that I plan to put in here, but not all at once. As a guiding principle, I've come the realisation that **incremental changes** are the way to go. So it makes sense that the first post is a guide and discussion on [how this very site was built and deployed][_post-welcome-to-jekyll---by-me]. After this, any progressive change will (hopefully) be accompanied by a post, note, or another form of study mechanism.
