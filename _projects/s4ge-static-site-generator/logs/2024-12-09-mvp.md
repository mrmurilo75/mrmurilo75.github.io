## Tasks

### Administrative

- [ ] Replicate these development tracking and decisions in the issues/milestones of the [official repo][s4ge]

### Implementation

- [ ] **Front-matter** configuration and user variables
    - layout
    - title, dates, ...

The first task will be gathering context to pass on to the jinja-in-md process (template constructs in md). This means, not only gathering context but also removing the front-matter from the file. ***For now*, just removing the front-matter and rewriting the file** is a valid option but it is probably not performance efficient.

- [ ] Templating constructs in md

Just run Jinja2 prior to rendering md - requires context.

- [ ] **Recursively** render md in inner folders

- [ ] Rebuild upon change - a standard feature of doit

- [ ] Apply **selected** templates

Create front-matter and **use it** in the process. Not all front-matter is to be put in context.

### Acceptance

- [ ] Migrate my personal site
