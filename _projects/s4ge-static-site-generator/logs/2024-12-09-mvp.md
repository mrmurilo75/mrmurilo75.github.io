## Status

### Continue at:

- [ ] Add task to remove and process front-matter into config dict - then acces from this dict in md templated
- [-] Improve current doit - continue with the [docs basics][doit-docs]
    - [X] Use 'file_dep' and 'targets' in metadata (for up-to-date detection)
    - [X] Use 'dependencies' and 'targets' in task executor function
    - [ ] Use [**task-group**](https://pydoit.org/tutorial-1.html#package-imports)
    - [ ] Find out way to connect processes - how can I pipe the outputs

### Completed:

- [X] Render template construct in md source (POC)
- [-] Improve current doit - continue with the [docs basics][doit-docs]
    - [X] Use 'file_dep' and 'targets' in metadata (for up-to-date detection)
    - [X] Use 'dependencies' and 'targets' in task executor function
- [X] Refactor logic into package
- [X] Refactor 'app' script
- [X] **Recursively** render md in inner folders

## Tasks

### Development

- [ ] !IMPORTANT! Add pre-commit to lint and test before commit or on push

### Administrative

- [X] Create separate development branch

- [ ] Replicate these development tracking and decisions in the issues/milestones of the [official repo][s4ge]

### Implementation

- [ ] Rebuild upon change - a standard feature of doit

Priority for ease of development.

- [ ] **Front-matter** configuration and user variables
    - layout
    - title, dates, ...

The first task will be gathering context to pass on to the jinja-in-md process (template constructs in md). This means, not only gathering context but also removing the front-matter from the file. ***For now*, just removing the front-matter and rewriting the file** is a valid option but it is probably not performance efficient.

- [ ] Templating constructs in md

Just run Jinja2 prior to rendering md - requires context.

- [X] **Recursively** render md in inner folders

- [ ] Apply **selected** templates

Create front-matter and **use it** in the process. Not all front-matter is to be put in context.

### Acceptance

- [ ] Migrate my personal site

## Notes

Reminder: Do thing **iteratively**. Write down the goal before implementation.

### doit

*task-****creator*** are ones that return tasks' *metadata*. They are - by default - define with the name prefix "**task_**" in the file `dodo.py`. The metadata is a dictionary with information to evaluate *if* a task needs to be executed (by up-to-date check), and how to execute it.

The most important metadata keyword is "**action**", which defines what will be done when the task is executed. The value of *"action"* can be a **list of strings** to be interpreted as **shell commands**, or **python functions**. In case of functions, each element is a tuple *(callable, args, kwargs\[optional])*

To make use of **up-to-date checks** to decide if tasks *need* to be executed, we fill the keywords "**file_dep**" and "**targets**" with **lists of filepaths** (as strings). The values of "*action*" can the make use of the "*dependencies*" and "*targets*" variables in a format string. If the **functions** in *"action"* accept the **arguments "*dependencies*" and "*targets*"** it will be injected with these values.

The *task-creator* functions can span multiple tasks (a **task-group**) if instead of *returning* a metadata dict, it **yields** tasks' metadatas. In this case, it requires that each task be uniquely identified by a "*name*" parameter.

#### getargs

The "*getargs*" keyword can be used to get values from another task. It is required that this task return a dict.

"*getargs*" value is a dict in which the keys are the argument name in the action function. The values are tuples with the task name, and the key to access the value in the result of the task. The format, therefore, is `{argument_key: (task_name, result_key)}`.

In the case of *taks-groups*, the value passed to the action function is a dict where keys are the names of the subtask and the values are the ones accessed in the result dict.

This piping requires that the passed values be **json serializable**.
