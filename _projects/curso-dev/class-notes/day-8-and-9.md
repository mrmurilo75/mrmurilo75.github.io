These classes are a little bit more philosophical and relate to Filipe's experience in development. I'll go even further and say that they relate to not only development but life in general. 

> As I enjoy these topics I already have personal notes that goes in line with his teachings, even though I have not put them in this site **yet**. When I do I'll link them here ~~if I remember~~.

## Organic vs. 3D Printing Development

Per Filipe's experience, there are two ways to structure development:

In the Organic model the project grows "organically" as it progresses. Think of a human being made. It starts out as one cell, that duplicates, and then another, and then a few cells become speciallized. Piece by piece, functionalities spurs out of the exisit mass.

On the other hand, in the 3D printer model the project is planned out and then made layer by layer. The middle steps are not functional states. This is a lot faster, and it makes sense if what's being done is something well known.

## Feedback System

It is important to have a feedback system, in which we can have feedback on the partial progress we made. This helps us be more confident in our application, and find problems along the way. Otherwise, we'll have all the feedback at the end, and, more often than not, all the issues will arise at once.

## How To Always Be Succefull

This is all about perspective. Even if something goes wrong, you now have the chance to learn. If you fix a problem it can still be succefull in teaching you how to do better. Have it be a success or failure depends only on how you react to it.

## Cost of Planning

We, as humans, do an intuitive energy-cost calculation for any task we do. Because planning is only as important as the result it brings, we aim to avoid that the cost of planning overcome the cost of doing. In fact, **planning should be like putting up guardrails**. It keeps you in the right track and moving forward.

There are different levels of planning that should be applied to different situation:

### Levels of Planning

#### 1. Personal Notes:

* Low cost of production:

It should be something with ease of access, like a paper note. You can quickly write it down.

* Low cost of cold start:

In the case of a paper note, leaving it in your desk will make it fast to access it. It doesn't take time to start up, load, or log in.

> This is Filipe's example.

#### 2. Group Notes:

Use something that can be shared across. Like a Kaban board or a white board. It should be visible to everyone, and have as low of cost of production as possible.

#### 3. Expanded Knowledge:

Use something where you can have extended knowledge, link, images, etc. There's a higher cost in both production and cold start, but also a higher level of important details. 

#### 4. Metrics:

Lastly, this is the easiest place to lose track of what's important. Metrics usually add an extra layer of work to a task. If the metrics tracking adds too much it might raise the cost of a task above its reward, making it cost ineffective. This is especially true the higher the complexity of the metrics tracking.

It should be as simple as possible, but still show all the relevant information. 

For example, in software development, if you only showed the metric of completed issues to total of issues, you would have the percentage both raise and lower. That's because it is not linear, and issues arise as you progress. How many issues were closed and how many were open is a much more relevant metric.

> This pretty closely relates to how I structure my project's planning. *Logs* being like the personal notes, *discussions* being like group notes (even though it's just me), *reports* being the expanded knowledge, and *index* being like a metrics tracker.

## Project Creation

### All or Nothing

We often see a big project as a huge monolith that needs to be brought into existence as a whole. It feels like there is no in-between: you either do it all in one go, or don't even try.

That's where planning and analysis will help you most. That huge monolith you imagine can be broken down into many many bricks, that we are going to build up our project.

### Inception Issue

The inception issue is an analysis of the project goals and strategy. A "reality check" for the project idea and **why it exists**.
