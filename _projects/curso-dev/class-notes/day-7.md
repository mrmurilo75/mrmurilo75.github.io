For hosting we'll use [Vercel](https://vercel.com), which is the creator of the *Next.js* framework.

1. Going to vercel and creating a Login, with the *hobby* option.
2. Click on the front page to import the github repo. It will show a pop-up for authentication and selecting the repos.
3. Click again on *Import* on the repo in the vercel interface. It will take you to a page where you can select *Build and Deploy*.

After this initial configuration, any new pushes are automatically pulled and deployed on Vercel.

[Here][vercel-commit-deplyed] is the link to the latest deployment at time of writing.
