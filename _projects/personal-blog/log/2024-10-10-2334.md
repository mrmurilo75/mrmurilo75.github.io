## Discussions

I have planned out the structure of the projects, based on what I've done previously (especially what I came up during the [negligent-octopus] project).

Besides this, I have decided not to plan too much of other notes. Although I have some ideas, they are still too foggy to even write down concisely. The solution I found is to not overthink and start notetaking. I'll reeval the structure when I have some more experience.
