## Thoughs on [strucuture]

I have revised this page and made it clearer. However useful for quick starting my work, I do think revising might just be procrastination (not all but at least some).

Index page: How to structure it. One move was to keep open and closed discussions. I want to have the planning in the index. But for a project index thats kind of genreal. 

Ok, I figure I am trying to destroy a meteor with an ak47. How to organize a project is a very complicated thing that has spawned a gamuth of software and techniques and so on. 

I figure the index should contain the guiding principles and rules, a map of how to move forward and a general landscape as well as the inspiration. Should be point to what the end goal is. That the main section: **Goals**. Ideas should be kept in the discussions. I think it is also very valid to define **scope**, this is not what will always be but what it is for now. This is akin to guardrails, as I put before. A **roadmap** is the last piece. Same as the scope keeps us on what it is now, the roadmap lists out what is the current planned work, so far, and what can be discussed in the future.

There is some work wwhere planning is almost as much work as just doing it. For these the "plan" shuld be only as much as a reminder.

Creating a categorization for open tasks is also veeeery important. But thats for more than just this plain text aproach. 
Currently categorizing in **content creation**, **Planning**, and **implementation**. Also added an **explore** section, which might be a page in the future - gotta **be careful not to lose focus**.

## Planned next actions

### Planning

* References pages (studies collection? Use either notes or projects for now)
* Eval a microposts section, or breaking down notebook with a category for raw notes and ready notes - maybe ready notes are posts?

### Content Creation

* Revisit this [reference and thoughts note] and rewrite the home page content
* Write a 'home' content for [Projects] and [Notebook] pages

### Implementation

* Write a Thoughts note about temporary solutions, based on [focus note] - when to use, when to revise, etc. 
* Change listing in [Projects], [Notebook], and [index] to be most-recent at the top
* Add to future steps: Logs, Reports, and Discussion in [index] will grow and make the page too big and hard to read. The layout might be a solution to be evaluated. 

### Explore

**Be careful not to lose focus**

* Jekyll plugins
