## Done

* Revisit pages and do minor fixes on content, titles, formats
* Create a lister page for the notebook
* Break down 'Some things to keep in mind' into notes in the notebook - The last section didn't have any reflection worth keeping.

## Planned next actions

* Change log listing in [index] to use date
* Revisit this [reference and thoughts note] and rewrite the home page content
* Write a 'home' content for [Projects] and [Notebook] pages
* Write a Thoughts note about temporary solutions, based on [focus note] - eval a microposts section, or breaking down notebook with a category for raw notes
* Change listing in [Projects], [Notebook], and [index] to be most-recent at the top
* Add to future steps: Logs, Reports, and Discussion in [index] will grow and make the page too big and hard to read. The layout might be a solution to be evaluated.
