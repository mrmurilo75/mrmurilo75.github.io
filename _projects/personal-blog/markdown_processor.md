I already see the power of Hypertexting and linking from using this blog, BUT I WANT MORE POWER!! 

One of the main features I miss so far is backlinking and positional linking. I want to create my own processor so that the features can be added in. 

As this page is just an ideias page, there might be a lot of ways to do this. Maybe a jekyll plugin? 

## Features requirements

[ ] Positional linking

[ ] Backlinkg (Optional)

### Should I implmenet it by hand? 

I dont think that it would be too hard to do this. From my college classes I think that creating my own programming language was the closest to this, beacuse it would probably take a regex processing into tokens and then rendering.
