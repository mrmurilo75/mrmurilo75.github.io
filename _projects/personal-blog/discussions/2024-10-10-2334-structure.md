## Conclusion

* Use a simpler and familiar structure:
```
_projects/
    `- [project]/
        `- project_index
            |- [feature]/
            |   |- feature_index (with planned work and tracking)
            |   `- logs/
            |- logs/
            |- reports/
            `- discussions/
                `- closed/
_notebook/
```

### Projects

#### Planning

Each project will have an index page containing general information. If a project is just an ideia, this page can outline motivation and link to inspirations. Once a project begins to grow and has a more concrete plan, those ideas and references will be kept into the discussions folder. This is a free space to take notes, keep inspirations, and think of next steps. From these will come the decisions on which features to implement, define priorities, etc. To keep things clean and clear, there will be a conclusions section.

In case the conclusion is to implement a feature, a plan needs to be laid out. This can be done directly in the conclusion section for simpler features or by creating a substructure, with it's own index page containing the plan. 

#### Monitoring

During implementation the smaller decisions (such as whether to implement using X or Y design pattern), references, and other information should be noted in the logs. These are the real-life save files. They should have all the information necessary to pick back up where you left - even if starting from a blank workspace.

#### Reviewing

Once a feature is implemented or a milestone is reached, the logs should be revised into a report. Reviewing relevant information, code snippets, time spent, what went right and what might have been better if done differently. The reports should provide a concise view of the work done and serve as a reference for similar work in the future.

### Notebook

For general essays I'll simply keep notes of ideas and references. I'm sure a structure will come up as I'll use and revisit them.

## Notes

**2024-10-10**

See [log][2024-10-10-log] for raw notes.

> **To get moving, implement the path of least resistence.**

I have planned out the structure of the projects, based on what I've done previously (especially what I came up during the [negligent-octopus] project).

Besides this, I have decided not to plan too much of other notes. Although I have some ideas, they are still too foggy to even write down concisely. The solution I found is to not overthink and start notetaking. I'll reeval the structure when I have some more experience.

**2024-10-15**

See [log][2024-10-15-log] for raw notes.

* Index should be a guiding page: contain **Goals**, **Scope**, **Roadmap**. List **Discussions**, **Logs**, **Reports**.
