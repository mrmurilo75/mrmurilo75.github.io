In a world ruled by algorithms, where 'subscribing' to a channel on youtube or 'following' a creator on instagram means close to nothing, I have decided to take matters into my own hands. This page is a hub for myself to list realible sources of valueable content, whithout the distractions of a feed.

> This page is a work in progress. It has been kickstarted into existence and will grow progressively.
