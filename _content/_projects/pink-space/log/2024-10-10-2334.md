## Thoughs that result in the discussion on [strucuture]

So I am having waaay too many thoughts and a hard time trying to organize my thoughts in a zettelkasten. It is a method I do not know, so probably no the best one to start, when I am just satarting out this blog. Instead I should probably try to reimplement things I do have done before and possibly pass on to zettelkasten. Although the idea of many notes that connet seem nice, I much rather have some locallity of behaviour, like have longer pages where each section is a zettel.

But even before having any zettel I should first add a little more structure to the project planning, and plan for the iterations, and plan for a know workflow. **To get moving, implement the path of least resistence.** Once you are already moving, then you can start to drive, give direction.

Once features are implemented, the learning and decisions should provide a report. The reports should include and link to relevant information including code snippets and time spent.
