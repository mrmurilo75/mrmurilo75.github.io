# mrmurilo75.github.io

This branch is a test the usability of [s4ge](https://github.com/mrmurilo75/s4ge-static-site-generator/) at it's current state ([commit ebde963](https://github.com/mrmurilo75/s4ge-static-site-generator/tree/ebde963df0e24587c8b5f14d386de42884c286e6)).

1. Run the command `doit` from the projects root to create the site output.
2. From a terminal, access the `_site/` folder.
3. Run a local server with `python -m http.server`. This will serve the site on the port 8000.

> Make sure you have `python` installed.
