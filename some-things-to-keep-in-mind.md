## Focus

This is not the page that I wanted to make. As per [the next step][next-step] at time of writing, I would be continuing the implementation of this site using the collections of Jekyll. But that would require time and focus, which I haven't had. I got side-tracked on installing and setting up a new Linux Laptop (I'll write a post about it later), as well planning how I'll move forward here, how to separate the content, make references, etc. Although planning and preparing your environment truly is important, sometimes we get too caught up in the planning and forget about the doing. It was taking me too long to set up the environment to put the information in here, so I'll make this a temporary solution. I'll put some things that I want to keep in mind, notes, or some reference that I want to get back to. I'm not forgetting that the objective of this project is to 1. put information in a way that is accessible to myself, and 2. organize it in such a way that I can reference it. For the time, I'll focus on the first rather than the latter.

I decided to create a colletion 'log' to keep track of what I'm doing. This is similar to the what I'm writing in [the next step][next-step] 'Tracker' section.

I want to have another section 'reflections' to write notes related to something I'm seeing/reading/living and reflect on a topic. Skip this for now, not sure of it's usefulness given 'zettelkasten' and 'posts'.

I found a [blog for a guy named Andrew Whipple][andrewwhipple]. It seems somewhat similar to what I want to do here. He doesn't seem to be very worried about the form of the content, or trying to get people to the site or anything like that (sorry if this seems like a diss). But I liked it and related to it. Seems like just a space online for yourself, where you write stuff and if people see it, then they see it. I've seen a lot of people on linkedin comment linking to longer posts on their own blog's (which is how I think I found this). Blogging seems like a way to create a space for yourself online, for those that have the skills for it or that really want it to. I find myself looking for these more reliably than social media where people want to get attention and followers. I might never visit this guy's site again, there's a lot less incentive to be dramatic or create content for views and likes.

A lot to think about for next projects: [Video podcast of DHH (Ruby on Rails) with Prime and Deej][DHH-with-prime-and-deej]
* What do I want to do? I want to try things, including other languages. For web, Ruby might be a good idea
* Try things out, just do it
* Contributing to open source seems nice - a exchange of gifts: I can do this, and other people do what they can

Related to the [video with DHH][DHH-with-prime-and-deej] as well is [Omakube, by DHH][omakube] - this is not only something that is in line with what I tried to do before with my [bin setup repo]() but also is beutiful. I'd love to have something that looks like this. 

Also with surfing about Omakub I found [this blog][desipenguin-blog] from a software developer as well, and that has to amazing things:
What I was my ideia of 'log', this person is calling *microposts*
Also, she categorizes her blog as an [E/N Style Blog][desipenguin-en-post] which I am really exited to have figured is something people are doing, and that I thing this project falls into as well.

As per notes above, I'll only implement 2 collections (besides _post): Projects and Zettelkasten

The zettelkasten works for general notes, 'logs', and 'micropost'. I'll group them using tags, and entry points are the notes (or zettels) that don't have any other as theis source. 
    Note: I havent used the [Zettelkasten method][zettelkasten] yet, so I expect it to start taking form as I use it. Once I am more confortable with it I'll reevaluate and make a better structure if needed. 

Projects notes will be group by folder and consequently by category (each project will be a category/folder). As an entry point for a project will have a blueprint page, which will link to the other notes or index pages as needed. Again, this will take form with use and can be reestructured if necessary.

### Implementing:

1. Add [collections with output][jekyll-docs-collections-output].
2. Create the \_folder and listing page
