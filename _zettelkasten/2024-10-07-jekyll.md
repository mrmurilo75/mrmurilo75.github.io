## What is Jekyll

[Jekyll][jekyll-site] is a static site generator, specifically focused on blogging.

It is [integrated with Github Pages][gh-pages-jekyll], so there's no need to keep the generated content in the repo
(and it can be [easily setup with a template github action][2024-09-17-welcome-to-jekyll---by-me]).

It uses [Liquid as the templating engine][jekyll-liquid].
